    "# UClick\n",
    "\n",
    "`UClick` is an open source software written in Python to register Control Points on images for further use in [UCalib](https://github.com/Ulises-ICM-UPC/UCalib) and [UDrone](https://github.com/Ulises-ICM-UPC/UDrone).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is aimed to assist the registration of pixel coordinates corresponding to Control Points for subsequent image calibration. Two types of control points are distinguished: points located on the horizon (Horizon Points, HP) and points located in known coordinates (Ground Control Points, GCP), for which a file with their coordinates will be supplied. The output files can then be used afterwards for manual calibration of images in [UCalib](https://github.com/Ulises-ICM-UPC/UCalib) and [UDrone](https://github.com/Ulises-ICM-UPC/UDrone). A code to verify the quality of the GCPs used in the manual calibration of the images is also provided\n",

    "### Requirements and project structure\n",
    "To run the software it is necessary to have Python (3.8) and install the following dependencies:\n",
